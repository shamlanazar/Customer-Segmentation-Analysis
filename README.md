# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis

## Overview
This machine learning project focuses on customer segmentation analysis using the K-means clustering algorithm. By leveraging libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and mpl_toolkits, we successfully created segments of customers based on distinct patterns within the dataset. The project involves dataset analysis, visualization, and efficient application of K-means clustering to identify and analyze customer clusters.

## Modules Used
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations and array manipulation.
- **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib:** Employed for data visualization and plotting.
- **Seaborn:** Utilized for enhanced data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** Applied for implementing the K-means clustering algorithm.
- **mpl_toolkits:** Used for 3D plotting to visualize complex relationships in the dataset.
